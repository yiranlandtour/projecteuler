# Project Euler Solutions in Rust

Welcome to the Project Euler Solutions repository! This project contains solutions to various mathematical problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), implemented in the Rust programming language.

## About Project Euler

Project Euler is a collection of challenging mathematical and computational problems. The problems are designed to require more than just mathematical insights to solve; they often require efficient algorithms and clever programming techniques.

## Why Rust?

Rust is a systems programming language that offers memory safety without a garbage collector. It is known for its performance, reliability, and productivity, making it an excellent choice for solving computational problems efficiently.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the solutions, you need to have Rust installed on your machine. You can install Rust using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/), the recommended tool for managing Rust versions and associated tools.
